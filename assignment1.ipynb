       "'Lufthansa flies back to profit\\n\\nGerman airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.\\n\\nIn a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; Â£274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.\\nJapanese growth grinds to a halt\\n\\nGrowth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.\\n\\nOutput in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.\\n\\nThe economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.\\n\\nThe effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive.\\n\\nThe performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. \"Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,\" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \"Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. \"The amber light is flashing.\" The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japan\\'s massive public debt.\\n'"
